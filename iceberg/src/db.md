# Why not use a database?

- Enter Iceberg, but at this point why not just use a database?
    - databases are closed proprietary systems
        - everything must go through the database for processing
        - limited flexibility & increased cost w/ all access routing through a single system
            - w/ iceberg, the data is operated on in place, no need to go through other systems
