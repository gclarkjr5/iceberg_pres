# Database vs Data Lake

- What does a database have that a data lake didn't?
    - Schema of the dataset
        - columns and data types
    - what files exist and their organization -> partitions
    - coordination of changes to the dataset
        - DDL (data definition) -> columns & data types
        - DML (data modification) -> inserts, updates, deletes, etc.
