# Catalogs to the Rescue! Kinda...

![Hive Metastore](./images/hive_metastore.png) ![AWS Glue Catalog](./images/aws_glue.png)

- deployed on top of lake file storage
- brought a way to strictly define definition to the data
    - organizing data into groups: namespaces, tables, etc.
    - defining data at the table level: column names, data types, partitions
- BUT... static and only tell you what it is, not necessarily what it was
